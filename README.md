jquery-sortable
===============

A simple list with drag and drop functionality. You can also add items to the list and remove them.

I also added this functionality which keeps track of the current order of the list items:
```javascript
$ddr("#sortable > ul").sortable('toArray');
```
This uses some of the jQuery UI functionality for the drag and drop aspect.
